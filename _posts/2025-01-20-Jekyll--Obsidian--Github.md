**Make Your Own Free Pagan/Witchcraft Wiki (for Noobs)**

1. **Use Obsidian for Note-Taking**
    
    - Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a free app for creating a network of interconnected notes.
    - Think of it like a personal Wikipedia for all your witchy topicsâ€”rituals, spells, correspondences, etc.
2. **Set Up a Jekyll Website on GitHub**
    
    - Create a free GitHub account.
    - Use a [Jekyll template](https://jekyllrb.com/) (simple, free, and perfect for static sites).
    - Jekyll turns your markdown notes from Obsidian into a fully functional, searchable website.
3. **Sync and Share Your Wiki**
    
    - Export your Obsidian notes as markdown.
    - Push them to your GitHub repo, and let Jekyll generate your site automatically.
    - Bam! Youâ€™ve got your own wikiâ€”free hosting on GitHub Pages, easily maintained with just text files.

Now you have a personal witchy database you can share or keep private. No coding required, just a little setup magic. ðŸª„
