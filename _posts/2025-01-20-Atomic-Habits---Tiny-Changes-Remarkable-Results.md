Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results  
James Clear

HOW TO REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN TO ENJOY HARD HABITS  
You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have to do in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for your family.  
Now, imagine changing just one word: You don‚Äôt ‚Äúhave‚Äù to. You ‚Äúget‚Äù to.

*****

If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation ritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation. For instance, if you always play the same song before having sex, then you‚Äôll begin to link the music with the act. Whenever you want to get in the mood, just press play.

*****

Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.

*****

If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection.

*****

People think I work hard but I‚Äôm actually really lazy. I‚Äôm just proactively lazy. It gives you so much time back.‚Äù

*****

Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.  
Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.  
Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy.  
Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.  
Prime your environment to make future actions easier.

*****

The Two-Minute Rule states, ‚ÄúWhen you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.‚Äù

*****

Standardize before you optimize. You can‚Äôt improve a habit that doesn‚Äôt exist.

*****

What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.

*****

The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don‚Äôt.

*****

Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish.

*****

To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs in a small way.

*****

Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures‚Äîlike moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles‚Äîprovide clear evidence of your progress. As a result, they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity.

*****

food journals, workout logs, loyalty punch cards, the progress bar on a software download, even the page numbers in a book. But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a habit tracker.

*****

habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don‚Äôt want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit.

*****

The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:  
After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].

*****

It‚Äôs easy to train when you feel good, but it‚Äôs crucial to show up when you don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äîeven if you do less than you hope

*****

we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.

*****

An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us.

*****

Without variety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self-improvement.

*****

At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom.

*****

They provide an annual reminder to revisit my desired identity and consider how my habits are helping me become the type of person I wish to be. They indicate when I should upgrade my habits and take on new challenges and when I should dial my efforts back and focus on the fundamentals.

*****

Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time

*****

If you‚Äôre having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn‚Äôt you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don‚Äôt want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.‚Äù

*****

With the Four Laws of Behavior Change, you have a set of tools and strategies that you can use to build better systems and shape better habits. Sometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you‚Äôll need to make it obvious. Other times you won‚Äôt feel like starting and you‚Äôll need to make it attractive. In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too difficult and you‚Äôll need to make it easy. And sometimes, you won‚Äôt feel like sticking with it and you‚Äôll need to make it satisfying.

*****

This is a continuous process. There is no finish line. There is no permanent solution. Whenever you‚Äôre looking to improve, you can rotate through the Four Laws of Behavior Change until you find the next bottleneck. Make it obvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy. Make it satisfying.

is on the other side of sacrifice. Response (sacrifice of energy) always precedes reward (the collection of resources). The ‚Äúrunner‚Äôs high‚Äù only comes after the hard run. The reward only comes after the energy is spent.

Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying
