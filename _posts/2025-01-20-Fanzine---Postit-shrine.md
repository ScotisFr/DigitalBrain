### **Fanzine Shrine**

- **Mini Zines and Collages**: Create a series of pocket-sized fanzines dedicated to Deity/Bob Ross, featuring quotes, mini picture, or even snippets of “happy little accidents” messages. 
- **Collaborative Zine Shrine**: Set up a small zine-making station with blank pages, magazines, and art supplies, encouraging others to contribute pages inspired by deities. It would grow over time as more people add to it.

### 2. **Post-It Note Shrine**

- **Interactive Post-It Wall**: Create a corner with a central photo of the deity, then invite people to add Post-Its around it with quotes, mini paintings, or reflections on art. You could even leave some prompts like, “What would Bob say?” or “Draw your own happy little tree.”
- **Spontaneous Offerings**: Leave Post-Its on objects in the atelier that embody “happy little accident” moments (like an imperfect brush or a splotchy canvas), so the “shrine” is decentralized, celebrating art’s imperfections all over the space.
### **Give Each Person Creative Freedom on Their Page**

- **Themes and Layouts**: Set the guidelines that each page represents a “shrine” or “sanctuary” and let everyone interpret that freely. Encourage different styles, like collages, digital art, hand-drawn sketches, poems, quotes, and personal reflections.
- **Size and Dimensions**: Decide on a consistent page size so that when it’s all compiled, it looks cohesive. Common choices are A4 or A5 (8.5” x 11” or 5.5” x 8.5”).
- **Tools and Resources**: Suggest that people use images, symbols, or icons that are meaningful to their practices, such as natural elements, colors, or shapes associated with their deities or beliefs.
