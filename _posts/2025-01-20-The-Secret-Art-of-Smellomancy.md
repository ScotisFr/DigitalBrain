 Use your newly charged potion.
With different flavors of positive energy bound up in each scent, you can apply your attitude like you apply moisturizer. Spritz on your fragrance whenever you need a boost, and the smell will provide little reminders of the way you want to feel all day.

Mix up your smellomancy.
Try channeling positive emotions into traditionally masculine fragrances like sandalwood, vetiver, and leather. Don’t wear cologne? A nicely scented body wash, deodorant, or shaving cream can store emotional power.
