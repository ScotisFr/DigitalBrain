Your body is part of you, but it isn‚Äôt all of you emotionally?  
‚Ä¢Do I feel the need to ‚Äúabsorb‚Äù their needs, making their happiness my sole responsibility?  
‚Ä¢Is my need to please them consuming my individual needs and wants?  
‚Ä¢Is there room for ‚Äúme‚Äù in this relationship, and is this person open to allowing me my freedom to express myself?

*****

What makes me feel most content and satisfied with my daily life?
