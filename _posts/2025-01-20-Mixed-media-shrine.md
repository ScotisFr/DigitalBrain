### **Modular Shrine Corners**

- Set up a few ‚Äúopen shrine‚Äù corners, each designated for a different theme (like nature, ancestors, creativity). People can add their items and offerings based on their own beliefs‚Äîsuch as crystals, herbs, symbols, or personal artwork that honors their deities.
- Keep a set of basic supplies, like wooden boxes, small jars, and candle holders, which can be rearranged or decorated based on who‚Äôs using them.

### 2. **Mixed-Media Art Altars**

- Use shadow boxes or reclaimed picture frames to make mini altars where each person can add mixed-media art: think of collage, pressed plants, or simple paintings that honor nature spirits, gods, or other figures.
- Let each person or small group design an altar with symbolic objects and images in their own way, creating a ‚Äúgallery of shrines‚Äù with personal touches.

### **Herbal and Crystal Wall**

- Create a pegboard or open shelf for an ‚Äúherbal and crystal wall‚Äù where people can add items tied to their deities or spiritual practices. Jars for dried herbs, small dishes for stones or crystals, and little tags explaining each item's significance could make this a sacred art collection.
- You could incorporate small pouches or cards where people can leave messages or intentions for specific deities or natural elements.

### 5. **A Personal ‚ÄúPrayer Flag‚Äù Section**

- Create a wall space where people can hang fabric squares, ribbons, or even paper ‚Äúprayer flags‚Äù that represent their beliefs, favorite quotes, or prayers to different deities. Each person could add symbols, words, or colors tied to their beliefs.
- As the collection grows, it becomes a colorful, eclectic tapestry honoring diverse practices.

### 6. **Community Art Offering Basket**

- Place a basket in a central spot where people can leave small art offerings, tokens, or notes. For example, someone could leave a painted stone for a nature deity, a hand-drawn symbol, or a poem. Over time, the offerings create a kind of communal altar that holds the spirit of everyone‚Äôs contributions.
- You could even encourage people to make small ‚Äúblessings‚Äù (tiny folded paper with art or words) and allow others to take one if they leave something in return.

### 7. **Found Object and Symbol Mosaic**

- Set up a blank mosaic wall or table where people can add found objects, small tiles, or symbolic items. The mosaic could include icons, symbols, or natural objects that represent different beliefs. Over time, it would grow into a visual representation of everyone‚Äôs traditions.
- People could bring items that are meaningful to them (like feathers, metal scraps, or beads) to add to this shared sacred collage.
