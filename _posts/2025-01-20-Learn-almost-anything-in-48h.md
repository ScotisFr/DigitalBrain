How to Learn Almost Anything in 48 Hours
Tansel Ali

Remembering names
Names are forgotten because they are abstract in nature. There is no image for our brains to connect and store. So the trick to remembering names is to create the image and make an association.

*****

Mind mapping
Mind mapping helps you organise information and ideas in a non-linear manner

*****

How it works

Take the main topic and put it at the centre of a page.

Create section headings like thick branches starting at one o’clock and moving clockwise.

Create subheadings from the section headings.

Use colour and images throughout to engage the brain

*****

Practise speed reading with a variety of materials to help you build your visual reading skills. It is not the easiest of memory techniques, but it may prove to be the most rewarding.

*****

Remembering names
A good way to remember names is to visualise the person first. What’s memorable about their appearance? Do they have a big nose? Long hair? Piercings? Exaggerate some feature even if they look remarkably normal otherwise. By doing this we create a strong holding spot for our information to be memorised—in this case the person’s name.

*****

Use mind mapping to organise writing projects for articles, essays and reports.

*****

Make sure you memorise the pronunciations before memorising phrases. It will make learning much more effective.

*****

Speed reading test
Have a stopwatch ready and hit start when you begin reading the following article. When you come to the end hit stop and record your time. Follow the instructions to get your reading speed in words per minute (WPM).

*****

Memorise how to say ‘hello’ to others in other languages.
