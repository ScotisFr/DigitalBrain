I
There are things which are within our power, and there are things wich are beyond our power. Within our power
are opinion, aim, desire, aversion. "
" If it concerns anything beyond our power, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you. "

II
" Remove the habit of aversion, then, from all things that are not within our power, and apply it to thing
undesirable which are within our power. Restrain desire ; for if you desire any of the things not within our own
power, you must necessarily be disappointed; and you are not yet secure of those which are within our power;
and so legitimate objects of desire. "
V
" When, therefore, we are hindered or disturbed, or grieved, let us never impute it to others, but to ourselves. "
VIII
"Demand not that events should happen as you wish; but wish them to happen as they happen, and you will go
on well."
XIII
" If you would improve, be content to be thought foolish and dull with regards to externals. "
XIX
" Do not desire to be a general, or a senator, or a consul, but to be free. "
XXV
" If another, then, paying an obulus, takes the lettuces, and you, not paying it, go without them, do not imagine
that he has gained any advantage over you. "
XXIX
" Consider first, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. For different persons are made for
different things."
" You must be one man, either good or bad. "
XLVII
" When you are violently thirsty, just rinse your mouth with water, and tell nobody. "
Footnotes
" Happiness, the effect of virtue, is the mark which the Logos has set up for us to aim at. "
