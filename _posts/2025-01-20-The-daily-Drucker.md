The daily Drucker _ 366 days of insight and motivation for getting the right things done

Parts exist in contemplation of the whole.

*****

action point:Are you personally committed to getting results at work, or are you just going through the motions? Do you lack the authority to produce results? Either get it, or look for another job.

*****

As the first such basic competence, I would put the willingness, ability, and self-discipline to listen. Listening is not a skill; it is a discipline.
Anybody can do it. All you have to do is to keep your mouth shut. The sec-ond essential competence is the willingness to communicate, to make your-self understood. That requires infinite patience. The next important competence is not to alibi. Say: ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt work as well as it should. Let‚Äôs take it back and reengineer it.‚Äù The last basic competence is the willing-ness to realize how unimportant you are compared to the task. Leaders sub-ordinate themselves to the task.

*****

What motivates knowledge workers is what motivates volunteers. Volunteers have to get more satisfaction from their work than paid employees, precisely because they don‚Äôt get a paycheck. They need, above all, challenges.
action point:Provide your best employees with satisfying challenges.

*****

‚ÄúThink globally, act locally.‚Äù

*****

T he next society will be a knowledge society. Its three main characteris-tics will be:
‚Ä¢ Borderlessness, because knowledge travels even more effortlessly than money.
‚Ä¢ Upward mobility, available to everyone through easily acquired formal education.
‚Ä¢ The potential for failure as well as success. Anyone can acquire the ‚Äúmeans of production,‚Äù that is, the knowledge required for the job, but not everyone can win.

*****

action point:Look at people as resources to be developed. Take steps to expose your people and yourself to the best ideas and see to it that they are trained in how to apply them.

*****

The first step in making the manual worker productive is to look at the task and to analyze its constituent motions. The next step is to record each mo-tion, the physical effort it takes and the time it takes. Then motions that are not needed can be eliminated. Then each of the motions that remain as es-sential to obtaining the finished product is set up so as to be done the sim-plest way, the easiest way, the way that puts the least physical and mental strain on the operator, the way that requires the least time. Then these mo-tions are put together again into a ‚Äújob‚Äù that is in logical sequence. Finally, the tools needed to do the motions are redesigned.

*****

action point:Define your task as a knowledge worker by asking your-self: ‚ÄúWhat do I get paid for?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat should I get paid for?‚Äù

*****

ction point:Define quality for your job

*****

action point:What do you want to be remembered for?

*****

If the thoughtful answer to the question ‚ÄúWhere do I belong?‚Äù is that you don‚Äôt belong where you currently work, the next question is why?

*****

action point:Reflect on how your favorite nonprofits can help create new communities in cities.

*****

T hose who perform love what they‚Äôre doing. I‚Äôm not saying they like everything they do. That‚Äôs something quite different. Everybody has to do a lot of the routine; there‚Äôs an enormous amount of the routine. Every great pianist has to do three hours of playing scales each day. And nobody will tell you they love it. You have to do it. It‚Äôs not fun, but you enjoy it be-cause even after forty years you still feel the fingers improving. Pianists have a wonderful expression I heard many years ago: ‚ÄúI practice until I have my life in my fingers.‚Äù And, sure, it‚Äôs a dull routine, but you enjoy it.
The same is true of people I‚Äôve seen in business who enjoy the work.
Their routine is: It‚Äôs got to be done, and I enjoy it because I enjoy the work.
And that is the difference, I believe, not between mediocrity and perform-ing, but between what you call a ‚Äúlearning organization‚Äù‚Äîone where the whole organization grows and then the process changes‚Äîand an organiza-tion that maybe does very well but nobody misses it after five o‚Äôclock.
action point:Practice until you have your life in your fingers.

*****

action point:Does the mission of your enterprise fit the environment?
Do your core competencies fit the mission?

*****

What are the few things that your organization does su-perbly well? Stay focused on them.

*****

action point:Every month, prepare a page that lists opportunities, in-cluding areas where results were better than expected, whether in terms of sales, revenues, profits, or volume. Follow this with another page that lists the organization‚Äôs most capable people. Then allocate the best performers to the top opportunities.

*****

F irst, the public-service institution needs a clear definition of its mission.
What is it trying to do? Why does it exist? It needs to focus on objectives rather than on programs and projects. Programs and projects are means to an end. They should always be considered as temporary and, in fact, short-lived. Second, the public-service institution needs a realistic statement of goals. It should say, ‚ÄúOur job is to assuage famine,‚Äù rather than, ‚ÄúOur job is to eliminate hunger.‚Äù It needs something that is genuinely attainable and therefore a commitment to a realistic goal, so that it can say eventually, ‚ÄúOur job is finished.‚Äù Most objectives can and should be phrased in opti-mal rather than in maximal terms. Then it is possible to say, ‚ÄúWe have at-tained what we were trying to do.‚Äù Third, failure to achieve objectives should be considered an indication that the objective is wrong or at least de-fined wrongly. If an objective has not been attained after repeated tries, one has to assume that it is the wrong one. Failure to attain objectives is a prima facie reason to question the validity of the objective‚Äîthe exact opposite of what most public-service institutions believe.
action point:Write down your nonprofit institution‚Äôs mission. Is it at-tainable or is it an open-ended, wishful statement? If it‚Äôs the latter, replace it with a realistic and genuinely attainable statement of goals.

*****

action point:Apply these four marketing lessons to your business: Don‚Äôt try to buy customers. Ask, ‚ÄúWhat is the market for what the product does?‚Äù
Consider all customers in the market. Exploit demographic changes.

*****

action point:Are your institution‚Äôs products and services meeting the actual needs of your customers? If not, does this explain your marketing dif-ficulties?

*****

Simplicity makes for clarity.

*****

There is an old banker‚Äôs rule of thumb according to which one assumes that bills will have to be paid sixty days earlier than expected and receivables will come in sixty days later.

*****

action point:Find out where your time goes by recording, managing, and consolidating your time.

*****

action point:Create a time log of your activities. Eliminate those ac-tivities that are time wasters.

*****

action point:Consolidate your time and set aside large blocks of time to complete major tasks.

*****

action point:Maintain a constant focus on the contribution you can and should make to your organization.

*****

They need opportunity; they need achievement; they need fulfillment; they need value

*****

What should I contribute?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhere and how can I have results that make a difference?

*****

action point:Define results for your position that will make a differ-ence. How can you make the greatest contribution based upon your strengths? Establish goals and set deadlines for them.

*****

action point:Develop an interest that does not subject you to the com-petitive pressures you face at work. Try to find a community in this area of outside interest.

*****

Controls in a social institution such as a business are goal-setting and value-setting. They are not ‚Äúobjective.‚Äù

*****

Remember, ‚ÄúWhat you measure is what you get.‚Äù Ensure that every measure of performance is pertinent to the achievement of a goal or value of your organization. Otherwise, you risk misdirecting your organi-zation.

*****

action point:List both nonmeasurable and measurable variables that are important to the achievement of the goals of your organization. De-velop quantitative assessments for those variables that can be so measured and qualitative assessments for those critical variables that are qualitative.

*****

A social institution is comprised of persons, each with his own purpose, his own ambitions, his own ideas, his own needs. No mat-ter how authoritarian the institution, it has to satisfy the ambitions and needs of its members, and do so in their capacity as individuals through in-stitutional rewards and punishments, incentives, and deterrents. The ex-pression of this may be quantifiable‚Äîsuch as a raise in salary. But the system itself is not quantitative in character and cannot be quantified.

*****

action point:Specify the system of rewards and punishments in your organization, including the procedure used for making promotion deci-sions. Evaluate the performance measures in place in your organization.
Make sure that good performance on the performance measures leads to rewards, promotions, and punishments.

*****

A decision process requires clear specifications as to what the decision has to accomplish.

*****

The more concisely and clearly boundary conditions are stated, the greater the likelihood that the decision will indeed be an effective one and will accomplish what it set out to do.

*****

O ne has to start out with what is right rather than what is acceptable precisely because one always has to compromise in the end. But if one does not know what is right, one cannot distinguish between the right compromise and the wrong compromise‚Äîand will end up by making the wrong compromise

*****

Building Action into the Decision A decision is only a hope until carrying it out has become somebody‚Äôs work assignment and responsibility, with a deadline.

*****

Converting a decision into action requires an-swering several questions:
‚Ä¢ Who has to know of this decision?
‚Ä¢ What action has to be taken?
‚Ä¢ Who is to take it?
‚Ä¢ What does the action have to be so that the people who have to do it can do it?

*****

Religion should serve as a critic of society and not as a po-litical force.

*****

action point:Draft a proposal to turn a social program into an oppor-tunity for your organization or one you might start.

*****

T he nonprofit institution is not merely delivering a service. It wants the end user to be not a user but a doer. It uses a service to bring about a change in human beings. It attempts to become a part of the recipient rather than merely a supplier.

*****

action point:A nonprofit institution that becomes a prisoner of money-raising has a serious identity crisis. Have you seen examples of this in your associations with nonprofits?

*****

Effective Nonprofit Boards of Directors Membership on this board is not power; it is responsibility.
T o be effective, a nonprofit needs a strong board, but a board that does the board‚Äôs work. The board not only helps think through the institu-tion‚Äôs mission, it is the guardian of that mission and makes sure the organi-zation lives up to its basic mission. The board has the responsibility of making sure the nonprofit has competent management‚Äîand the right management. The board‚Äôs role is to appraise the performance of the orga-nization. The board is also the premier fund-raising organ of a nonprofit or-ganization.
Over the door to the nonprofit‚Äôs boardroom there should be an inscrip-tion in big letters that says: membership on this board is not power; it is responsibility. Board membership means responsibility not just to the or-ganization but to the board itself, to, the staff, and to the institution‚Äôs mis-sion. A common problem is the badly split board. Every time an issue comes up, the board members fight out their basic policy rift. This is much more likely in nonprofit institutions precisely because the mission is, and should be, so important. The role of the board then becomes both more important and more controversial. At that point, teamwork between the chairperson and chief executive officer becomes absolutely vital.

*****

An organization, no matter what it would like to do, can only do a small number of tasks at any one time. This is not some-thing that better organization or ‚Äúeffective communications‚Äù can cure

*****

action point:What is the small number of tasks that your large organi-zation is doing? Are they the right ones? If not, discontinue them and focus on others.

*****

action point:Identify three technologies that are transforming your business that have come from outside of your industry. Set up an intelli-gence system to gather information about these and other emerging tech-nologies and capitalize on them before your competitors do.

*****

action point:Identify key variables in your environment. Make sure you have intelligence information about each of these variables to mini-mize surprises.

*****

action point:Prepare a ‚Äúdevelopment budget‚Äù that contains funds to exploit opportunities. Make sure the budget provides stability of funding in good times and bad.

*****

T here is an old saying that good intentions don‚Äôt move mountains, bull-dozers do. In nonprofit management, the mission and the plan‚Äîif that is all there is‚Äîare the good intentions. Strategies are the bulldozers.
They convert what you want to do into accomplishment.

*****

action point:Develop a strategic planning process that focuses present decisions on the future welfare of your organization. Establish responsibil-ities for the implementation and monitoring of these strategic decisions.
Perform audits of the results of each strategic decision in order to improve your effectiveness in making strategic decisions.

*****

T here are five basic operations in the work of the manager.
‚Ä¢ Managers, in the first place, set objectives. They determine what the objectives should be. They determine what the goals in each area of objectives should be. They decide what has to be done to reach these objectives. They make the objectives effective by communicating them to the people whose performance is needed to attain them.
‚Ä¢ Second, managers organize. They analyze the activities, decisions, and relations needed. They classify the work. They divide it into manageable activities and further divide the activities into manageable jobs. They group these units and jobs into an organization structure. They select people for the management of these units and for the jobs to be done.
‚Ä¢ Next, managers motivate and communicate. They make a team out of the people who are responsible for various jobs.
‚Ä¢ The fourth basic element in the work of the manager is measurement. The manager establishes yardsticks‚Äîand few factors are as important to the performance of the organization and of every person in it.
‚Ä¢ Finally, managers develop people, including themselves.

*****

Objectives are not fate; they are di-rection.

*****

The only things that evolve by themselves in an organization are disorder, friction, malperformance.

*****

organization has to be transparent. People have to know and have to understand the or-ganization structure they are supposed to work in. Someone in the organi-zation must have the authority to make the final decision in a given area. It also is a sound principle that authority be commensurate with responsibil-ity. It is a sound principle that any one person in an organization should have only one ‚Äúmaster.‚Äù

*****

action point:Reflect on whether your organization is transparent, if decision-making authority is clear, whether authority is commensurate with responsibility, and whether each person has only one master.

*****

action point:Give people maximum responsibility by organizing ac-cording to the federal principle. Become an organization that develops nu-merous people.

*****

action point:Take steps to improve communications by asking recipi-ents to initiate an information exchange.

*****

point:Understand public reaction to company decisions. Un-derstand public attitudes toward the firm, and evaluate these attitudes.
Recognize that an enterprise exists at the will of the public.

*****

action point:Create a flat organization. Use information processing‚Äî its structure, its content, and its direction‚Äîto ensure that your organization is agile and effective.

*****

There has to be a ‚Äúcommon culture‚Äù or at least a ‚Äúcultural affinity.‚Äù

*****

S uccessful diversification by acquisition, like all successful diversifica-tion, requires a common core of unity

*****

T he most important obstacle to innovation is that public-service institu-tions exist, after all, to ‚Äúdo good.‚Äù This means that they tend to see their mission as a moral absolute rather than as economic and subject to a cost/benefit calculus. Economics always seeks a different allocation of the same resources to obtain a higher yield. In the public-service institution, there is no such thing as a higher yield. If one is ‚Äúdoing good,‚Äù then there is no ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù Indeed, failure to attain objectives in the quest for a ‚Äúgood‚Äù only means that efforts need to be redoubled.

*****

the closer one comes toward attaining one‚Äôs objective, the more efforts are called for
